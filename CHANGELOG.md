## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Continuous release workflow. Every push to `main` builds macOS and Windows installers and attaches them to a new GitHub Release.
- Tauri auto-updater. The app checks for updates on startup and via a manual button, downloads the new version, verifies the signature, and replaces the previous install in place.
- `SECURITY.md` with private vulnerability disclosure flow.
- Issue and pull request templates under `.github/`.
- Dependabot config for `npm`, `cargo`, and `github-actions`.
- CI workflow on every pull request: `npm run check`, `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -D warnings`, `cargo check`, `tauri build --debug` smoke job on macOS and Windows, and `gitleaks` scan.

### Changed

- README rewritten with a download section, first-run instructions for macOS Gatekeeper and Windows SmartScreen, and a build-from-source section.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` documents the branch model (`dev` for work, `main` for releases) and the version bump procedure.
- `.gitignore` now covers signing materials and bundle outputs.

### Security

- Repository audited for secrets in source and history. None found.
