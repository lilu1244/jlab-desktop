# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Linux desktop bundles. Releases now publish `.deb` (Debian / Ubuntu), `.rpm` (Fedora / RHEL / openSUSE), and `.AppImage` (universal) artifacts alongside the existing macOS DMG and Windows MSI. CI builds on `ubuntu-24.04` against `webkit2gtk-4.1`. README install section gained a "First run on Linux" block. Track the upstream advisories listed in `TODO/linux-builds-deb-rpm-appimage.md` (`glib` 0.18.5 and `rand` 0.7.3) on every Tauri minor bump.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-04

### Changed

- `SECURITY.md` "Signing keys" section rewritten to match reality: there is no in-app auto-updater today and no Tauri updater signing keypair in use. Updates remain manual via the GitHub Release page. The unused `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` and `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` env vars were dropped from both build jobs in `release.yml` to shrink the secret footprint in CI runners. (#8, #13)
- Bumped `tauri-plugin-dialog` from 2.7.0 to 2.7.1 (transitively `tauri-plugin-fs` 2.5.0 → 2.5.1). (#14)

### Fixed

- Scan-progress tip now reads "Up to 50 MB per file. 15 scans per minute." instead of the incorrect "Five scans per minute". The new wording matches the documented JLab API rate limit. (#9, #11)
- A corrupt `history.json` is no longer silently overwritten with an empty file on the next scan. The unparseable file is renamed to `history.json.corrupt` for inspection and a warning is written to the existing log control before the empty default is returned. Adds a regression test. (#10, #12)

### Security

- Inner-jar zip-bomb hardening (GHSA-9m5v-g42x-xq8f, CWE-409). `extract_largest_jar` previously trusted the central-directory `uncompressed_size` of the inner `.jar`, so a hostile `.zip` / `.mcpack` / `.mrpack` could declare a small size, pass the 50 MB pre-check, and then deflate gigabytes into a `Vec<u8>` before any HTTP call. The read is now capped with `Read::take(MAX_BYTES + 1)` and rejected when the cap is hit. Adds a regression test that builds an in-memory archive whose central directory lies about the inner jar's size.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- Local scan history. Past scans are summarized in `history.json` inside the Tauri app data dir, capped at 100 entries. Each entry stores the file name, size, SHA-256, severity counts, top severity, signature count, and an ISO 8601 timestamp. No file bytes, no signature payloads, no API response bodies are persisted. Writes are atomic (write to `.tmp`, then rename) and run on a blocking task pool. New `history_list`, `history_clear`, and `history_delete` Tauri commands back a redesigned idle dashboard and a dedicated history view with per-entry delete and bulk clear.
- SHA-256 click-to-copy chip in scan history rows and the recent-scans module. Falls back to `document.execCommand("copy")` on older WebViews.
- Idle landing reworked into a two-column dashboard: drop zone on top, a recent-scans module that previews the three latest scans, and a folder-watcher placeholder for the upcoming auto-scan feature.
- Continuous release workflow. Every push to `main` builds macOS and Windows installers and attaches them to a new GitHub Release.
- Tauri auto-updater. The app checks for updates on startup and via a manual button, downloads the new version, verifies the signature, and replaces the previous install in place.
- `SECURITY.md` with private vulnerability disclosure flow.
- Issue and pull request templates under `.github/`.
- Dependabot config for `npm`, `cargo`, and `github-actions`.
- CI workflow on every pull request: `npm run check`, `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -D warnings`, `cargo check`, `tauri build --debug` smoke job on macOS and Windows, and `gitleaks` scan.

### Changed

- Outbound API requests now identify with `x-jlab-client: desktop` instead of `web`, so the JLab server can tell desktop traffic from the public web client.
- RatterScanner threat-intel card rebuilt around the new server response shape (`safe`, `malicious`, `automatedSafe`, `hash`, optional `githubInfo`). Verified projects link straight to the upstream GitHub repo.
- Threat-intel parse path rewritten for diagnostics: full `std::error::Error` source chain, status code, content-type, content-encoding, body length, and a 256-byte snippet are logged on parse failure. The shared `reqwest` client now negotiates `gzip` and `brotli`; the threat-intel call asks for `identity` to sidestep transient decompression issues for that small body. The threat-intel timeout was raised from 15s to 60s to absorb upstream cold-start lookups (RatterScanner / VirusTotal).
- "Clear logs" now also truncates the active `debug.log` in addition to removing rotated files. Previously the active file was left untouched, so users could not actually free its bytes from the UI.
- API rate-limit references updated from 5 to 15 requests per minute per IP, matching the current public quota.
- README rewritten with a download section, first-run instructions for macOS Gatekeeper and Windows SmartScreen, and a build-from-source section.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` documents the branch model (`dev` for work, `main` for releases) and the version bump procedure.
- `.gitignore` now covers signing materials and bundle outputs.

### Security

- Local history stores only summary metadata. File bytes, signature match values, and raw API bodies never touch disk.
- History writes are atomic and serialized through a process-local mutex, so a crash mid-write cannot leave a half-written file.
- Repository audited for secrets in source and history. None found.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-02

### Changed

- Bumped `sha2` to `0.11`, `@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog` and `tauri-plugin-dialog` to `2.7.1`, `swatinem/rust-cache` to `2.9.1`, and `tauri-apps/tauri-action` to `0.6.2`. No user-facing changes.
- Release pipeline now extracts the matching section from `CHANGELOG.md` and posts it as the GitHub Release body, instead of just linking to the file.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-02

The first public release. Initial macOS (universal) and Windows (MSI) builds.
