Native desktop client for the public [JLab static JAR scanner](https://jlab.threat.rip). Drop a `.jar` (or a `.zip`, `.mcpack`, or `.mrpack` that contains one), the app uploads the file to the JLab API and shows the matched signatures grouped by severity. The HTTP upload runs in Rust, so no file bytes leak through the JavaScript layer.

## Features

- Drag and drop a `.jar`, `.zip`, `.mcpack`, or `.mrpack`. For container archives, the largest inner `.jar` is extracted and scanned.
- Native multipart upload from Rust (`reqwest` + `rustls`). No browser fetch on the hot path.
- Strict CSP. The webview can only talk to the Rust side. No outbound network from JavaScript.
- Severity-grouped signature view (`critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `info`) with file metadata, family tags, and a copy-friendly card layout.
- Inline error banner with a live `Retry-After` countdown for rate limits (HTTP 429).
- Local size validation (50 MB) and zip-magic check before any network call.
- Cancellable scans, phase-aware progress UI with a live event log.
- Small (well under 10 MB), starts fast, no telemetry, no auth.

## Download

Pre-built installers are published on the GitHub Releases page on every push to `main`.

- macOS (universal, Apple Silicon and Intel): `JLab.Desktop_x.y.z_universal.dmg`
- Windows (NSIS installer): `JLab.Desktop_x.y.z_x64-setup.exe`
- Windows (MSI): `JLab.Desktop_x.y.z_x64_en-US.msi`

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/NeikiDev/jlab-desktop/releases/latest).

### First run on macOS

The current builds are not yet signed with an Apple Developer ID. macOS Gatekeeper will warn that the app is from an unidentified developer or that the app is "damaged". This is expected for an unsigned binary downloaded from the internet.

Use one of these to allow the app:

1. Right-click the app in `Applications`, choose `Open`, then confirm the dialog. macOS remembers the choice.
2. Or remove the quarantine attribute from a terminal:

   ```bash
   xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/JLab Desktop.app"
   ```

Signed builds will land in a later release.

### First run on Windows

The current builds are not signed with a code-signing certificate. Windows SmartScreen will show "Windows protected your PC". Click `More info`, then `Run anyway`. Windows remembers the choice for that file.

Signed builds will land in a later release.

## Updates

Updates are manual. The app checks the GitHub releases API once on startup and, if a newer version is available, shows a small "Update to vX" button in the header that opens the release page in your browser. Nothing is downloaded or installed automatically. To update, grab the new installer from the [Releases page](https://github.com/NeikiDev/jlab-desktop/releases/latest) and run it. You can dismiss the update notice; it stays hidden until the next release.

## How it works

1. You pick a file (or drop one on the window).
2. The Rust side validates the extension and reads the first bytes to confirm the file is really a zip archive.
3. For container archives (`.zip`, `.mcpack`, `.mrpack`), the largest inner `.jar` by uncompressed size is extracted in memory. Inner jars over 50 MB are rejected up front, which guards against zip bombs.
4. Rust uploads the jar to `https://jlab.threat.rip/api/public/static-scan` via `multipart/form-data`. No file bytes cross the IPC boundary into the webview.
5. The frontend renders the response, grouped by severity.

The desktop client keeps the JavaScript side from making network calls. The Content Security Policy is restricted to `connect-src ipc:`, so any future `fetch()` would fail at runtime.

## Build from source

You need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20 or newer
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) 1.85 or newer (the project pins `rust-version = "1.85"`)
- The Tauri 2 platform prerequisites for your OS: <https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/>

Install and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

Useful commands:

```bash
npm run check                                                # TypeScript type-check
cargo check    --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml          # Rust type-check
cargo fmt      --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml          # format Rust
cargo clippy   --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml -- -D warnings
npm run tauri build                                          # release bundle
```

The release bundle lands in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

### Icons

The repo ships with the icons referenced in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. To regenerate them from a 1024 x 1024 PNG:

```bash
npm run tauri icon path/to/source.png
```

This populates `src-tauri/icons/` with all required sizes and formats (`.png`, `.icns`, `.ico`).

## API

The app talks to a single endpoint:

```
POST https://jlab.threat.rip/api/public/static-scan
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Field:        file (max 50 MB, .jar archive)
Rate limit:   5 requests / minute / IP
```

For `.zip`, `.mcpack`, and `.mrpack` drops, the desktop client opens the archive locally, picks the largest inner `.jar`, and uploads only that file. The endpoint itself only accepts `.jar`.

No authentication is required. See <https://jlab.threat.rip/api-docs.html> for the full schema.
